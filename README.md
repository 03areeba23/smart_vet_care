The proposed system aims to enhance the current pet care system by introducing several key features and improvements:
	
1. Interactive AI-based Chatbot: The system will incorporate an interactive AI-based chatbot that reduces the need for initial diagnosis. The chatbot will analyze pet symptoms and provide possible treatment options, offering pet owners quick and reliable assistance.

2. User-Friendly Interface: The application will feature an intuitive and user-friendly interface, prioritizing graphics over excessive text. This design approach ensures easy comprehension, particularly for users with limited literacy levels.

3. Nearest Veterinary Clinics: The application will include a module that locates and displays nearby veterinary clinics. This feature enables users to find and select the most suitable veterinary care provider for their pets based on their location.
Key Facilities in the Smart Vet Care Application:
•	AI Chatbot: Real-time communication with customers, providing immediate assistance.
•	Active Doctors: Displaying a list of active doctors with whom clients can chat and book appointments.
•	Nearby Veterinary Clinics: Utilizing user location data to showcase nearby veterinary clinics
